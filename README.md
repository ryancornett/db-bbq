# Danny Boone's BBQ -- website by Ryan Cornett  
## Code Kentucky Web Development pt 1 Fall 2022 Final Project  

---

"Danny Boone's BBQ" is named after my beloved uncle, Reuben Daniel Cornett (affectionately known as "Boone" by many).  
I'm passionate about smoking meats and providing good food to family, so I had a lot of fun with this project.
